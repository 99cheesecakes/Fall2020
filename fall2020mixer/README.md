# Fall Welcome Mixer

The [Computation Workshop](https://macss.uchicago.edu/content/computation-workshop) at the University of Chicago cordially invites you to attend this week's event. We welcome the new class of MACSS students, greet our returning second year's, and invite all faculty and guests to mingle with our students, discuss big ideas, and celebrate the first Computation Workshop of the academic year.

Students in the Masters of Computational Social Science program are expected to attend and join the discussion by posting a comment on the <a href="https://github.com/uchicago-computation-workshop/Fall2020/issues/1"> issues page </a> of the <a href="https://github.com/uchicago-computation-workshop"> workshop's public repository on GitHub.</a></p>

**Before the Fall Welcome Mixer**, each of you will:

- Think about whom and what you'd like to see at our workshop, and suggest (each proposal as a response to the issue page) one speaker or paper.
- Then, upvote (“thumbs up”) **at least 5** proposals from other people.

**Registration**: The presentation will be held virtually on Zoom.

Only accounts affiliated with the University of Chicago will be granted access.

Our faculty member, John Clindaneil, will present his work during our next workshop.
